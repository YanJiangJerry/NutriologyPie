But some steps need to be followed before running the website on your localhost:
* Step 1: Download the **Xampp** and install it: https://www.apachefriends.org/
* Step 2: Use **"git clone"** to clone the project **directly** into the path: xampp/htdocs/....
Now you can use " http://localhost/NutriologyPie/login " to run your project
